# What is Responsive Web Design
- Designing the website with multiple screen size/resolutions in mind.
- Sites should work under any platform, any browser size, any orientation. The user should have the power.

# Concepts to consider
- Media Queries - detecting the viewport size
- Flexible grid-based layout for relative sizing
- Flexible images

# Responsive Options
- RWD - fluid measurements, flexible grids, and varying CSS rules
- Adaptive Design (dynamic serving) - returns one of multiple version of a page based on the type of devices
- Separate Mobile site (.m) - a separate page URL for the mobile site

# Fonts Responsive
- px (pixel) - fixed size
- em - An em is the equivalent of the size (in pixels) defined in the CSS rule font-size.
- percentage
- rem (root em) - size relative to the root element (HTML)

## Ex. em 

### HTML

```css
.parent {
    yolo
}
```
